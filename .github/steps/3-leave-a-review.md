Hi Swapna / Kaustav,

As discussed, I’ve completed the high-level design and detailed requirements under SP-ESTG-5.
To proceed with the development setup, may I kindly request provisioning of the following resources:

1. Resource Group under the correct subscription
2. Storage Account (Blob + KeyVault access for encryption keys)
3. Function App (for File Ingestion + Decryption)
4. SFTP endpoint credentials (DIA > Westpac transfer)
5. App Insights / Logging access
6. Service Bus Namespace (if required based on final design)

Please let me know if anything additional is needed on my side.

Thanks,
Alex
