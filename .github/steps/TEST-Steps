When an existing vendor purchase order (PO) is updated in DBS, that vendor po is updated in D365FO. As an Accounts payable manager, I require that DBS Purchase order receipts are updated on purchase orders in D365FO so that AP can use the value in posting of vendor invoices.

Feature 1 – Vendor PO Update
User Story 1 – As a user, I want the Purchase Orders created in DBS to be sent to D365 F&O

Narrative & Scope
This is to allow a purchase order created in DBS to be integrated in D365 F&O via webservice (API). This should be done interactively and even during business hours without any record/ file locks.
