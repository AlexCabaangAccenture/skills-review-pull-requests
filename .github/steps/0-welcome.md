Update – 09 Dec
Blocking issue identified related to project setup:

Azure Subscription Access

Attempted to access subscription and deploy Azure Function.

Encountered error: “Subscription not found / not associated with this tenant.”

Demonstrated the issue to Kostab during call.

Awaiting escalation/confirmation from DevOps team.

Azure Repo Creation

Raised during sync with Kostab.

Repo creation required for committing initial code structure.

Kostab attempted setup but also does not currently have permissions.

Awaiting confirmation on who will provision the repo (DevOps or Admin Team).

I will proceed with all non-blocked activities (design review, YAML familiarization, flow analysis) while access issues are being resolved.

Let me know if any additional evidence or screenshots are required.
