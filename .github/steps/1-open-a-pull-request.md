Hi team, quick update:
I’ve already sent an email to Kostov and Swapna with the full list of access items required for SPSTG-38 / SPSTG-64 so we can proceed with development.

I attempted to raise the IQ requests myself in SailPoint, but after the recent role update my entitlements were reset. The system is currently blocking me from completing the request (Next button disabled + required access elements won’t apply).

Because of that, I escalated the request through email so the needed permissions can be raised on my behalf. Once the access is restored, I’ll continue with the remaining setup items.

Just keeping everyone in Manila looped in so there’s visible progress on this task.

Thanks!
