Hi team, quick update on the environment setup.

I re-attempted the SailPoint request for the Azure access group (same item we discussed earlier). When I select the entitlement, SailPoint shows a pop-up saying my AD account (W818140) was previously associated with this access, but it won't allow me to proceed — the checkbox won’t activate and the “Next” button is disabled.

The only option shown is “Create New Account,” which I believe is not appropriate for this type of request.

This seems related to the recent role change, and the prerequisite permissions needed to request Azure access are likely missing.

I’ve already sent the detailed request via email. Just sharing this update here so the team is aware that I cannot proceed through IQ self-service at the moment. Once the base permission is restored, I’ll continue with the setup.

Thanks!
