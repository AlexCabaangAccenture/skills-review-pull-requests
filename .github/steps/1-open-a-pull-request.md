Hi Kostov / Swapna,

As discussed earlier, my role has been corrected to Software Engineer and all my previous IQ entitlements were removed. I attempted to raise the IQ requests myself, but the SailPoint UI is currently not allowing selections or submissions (Next button disabled, access groups not applying, and role propagation seems incomplete).

To avoid further delays to SPSTG-38, could you please raise the following IQs on my behalf:

Required Access (SPSTG-38 – Estate Management Integration)

Azure Subscription Access

WNZL-Access-Azure-t3_d365connect_dev-Owner

(Primary subscription for our project)

Resource Group Access

Contributor access to the RG associated with the above subscription

Storage Account Access

Storage Blob Data Contributor

Storage Account Contributor

Function App Hosting Access

App Service Contributor

Function App Contributor

Key Vault Access

Key Vault Secrets User / Contributor

D365 API Access

Access to D365 File Upload API

Access to D365 Staging Record API

Azure DevOps Access

Repo create/read/write

Pipeline creation permission

Justification:
My previous access entitlements were revoked after the role change. These accesses are required to begin SPSTG-38 integration development (Blob ingestion, Function App deployment, D365 API integration). Without these accesses, development cannot proceed.

Let me know if you need any additional details.
Thank you!

— Alex
