Blocker: Azure Portal access (Error 53003).

I already checked SailPoint, located my entitlements, and identified the project as Estate Guardians (SPESTG).

To proceed, I need to know the correct Azure subscription name or Azure access group for this project so I can submit the request in SailPoint.
