Hi team,
While setting up my environment, I'm unable to access Azure Portal (Error 53003 – Restricted by Administrator).

I already checked SailPoint and reviewed my entitlements. I located my project as Estate Guardians (SPESTG) and verified my identity attributes.

I need confirmation on the correct Azure Subscription / Azure AD Group to request for this project so I can raise the correct access request.

Thanks,
Alex
